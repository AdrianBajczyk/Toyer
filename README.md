# Toyer
Training project summarizing a year of learning in the CodeCool company course. 
Here you will find a ready-made web application that enables remote control of toys powered by a microcontroller with a built-in Wi-Fi module. 
Each user who has access to the aforementioned device with a unique serial code can create an account and register the device to be able to control it. 
The application has modern programming solutions implemented, allowing for its expansion and easy management.
